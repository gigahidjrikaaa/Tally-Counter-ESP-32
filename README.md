# Tally-Counter
 Tally counter program for ESP-32 using SSD1306 OLED. Basically just a normal counter. The program would be a lot readable if I create the class in a library, but
 I have to upload 1 non-zipped file only.

# Requirements
  Coming Soon

# Schematics
  Coming soon

  To find I2C address, you can lookup "I2C Scanner Github" on Google.
